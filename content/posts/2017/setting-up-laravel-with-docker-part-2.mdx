In [part 1](https://subash.com.au/setting-up-laravel-with-docker-part-1/) of this post, we built a docker image to run [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) application. In this post we will install the same Laravel application but use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to do so. Docker compose allows to easily work with multi container applications and prevents from having to type large docker commands as we did in part 1. We will also use [redis](https://redis.io/) for caching and [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) for data storage along with nginx and PHP.

We will use official PHP, nginx and redis images instead of building our own. We will then use `docker-compose` to glue them all together and have a working laravel application.

### Directory structure

The directory structure of the application will look as follows:

```markup--code markup--pre-code
+-- laravel
|   +-- docker
|   |   +-- Dockerfile
|   |   +-- default
|   +-- docker-compose.yml
|   +-- app
```

### Building PHP image

Lets start writing `Dockerfile` and build our PHP container.

```markup--code markup--pre-code u-paddingRight0 u-marginRight0
FROM php:7.0-fpm
LABEL maintainer="Subash Adhikari <[email protected]>"
```

Our `Dockerfile` uses `php:7.0-fpm` docker image as base and set the maintainer details.

We use [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) command to define the container’s resources on runtime. We update the apt repository and install dependencies required by [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```markup--code markup--pre-code u-paddingRight0 u-marginRight0
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y git zlib1g-dev zip unzip \
    && php -r "readfile('http://getcomposer.org/installer');" | \
      php -- --install-dir=/usr/bin/ --filename=composer \
```

[PHP fpm container](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) comes with a utility script `docker-php-ext-install` that helps to install PHP extensions. We use that script to install `pdo_mysql` extension which is required by laravel to connect to `mysql` database. We also install php zip extension required by composer.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
&& docker-php-ext-install pdo_mysql zip \
```

And finally we cleanup.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
&& apt-get -y autoremove && apt-get clean \
&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* /var/www/html/*
```

Our final Dockerfile looks as follows.

```markup--code markup--pre-code u-paddingRight0 u-marginRight0
FROM php:7.0-fpm

LABEL maintainer="Subash Adhikari <me@subash.com.au>"

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y git zlib1g-dev zip unzip \
    && php -r "readfile('http://getcomposer.org/installer');" | \
      php -- --install-dir=/usr/bin/ --filename=composer \
    && docker-php-ext-install pdo_mysql zip \
    && apt-get -y autoremove && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/* /var/www/html/*
```

### Docker compose

Docker compose allows to easily work with multiple containers without having to type large docker commands. We will start by adding following commands to `docker-compose.yml`.

We specify that we want to use version 2 of docker compose in first line. We then create some volumes and network to use between containers. We will add all containers in `app-network` so they can communicate with each other.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
version: '2'
volumes:
  mysqldata:
    driver: "local"
  redisdata:
    driver: "local"
networks:
  app-network:
    driver: "bridge"
```

Each containers in docker compose is referred as `services`. Lets start by adding our main `app` container.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./docker
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: adikari/laravel
    volumes:
      - ./app/:/var/www/html/
    networks:
      - app-network
```

We specify docker compose to use image `adikari/laravel` if available. If not create one using the `Dockerfile` in the `./docker` directory. We then mount current working directory `./app` to `/var/www/html` of the container. Finally, we add the container to `app-network`.

Next, we will build `nginx` container. Instead of installing manually like in [part 1](https://subash.com.au/setting-up-laravel-with-docker-part-1/), we will simply use the [official nginx docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/).

```markup--code markup--pre-code
nginx:
    image: nginx:1.12-alpine
    volumes:
      - ./app/:/var/www/html/
      - ./docker/default:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    ports:
      - 8000:80
    networks:
      - app-network
```

We are using `nginx:1.12-alpine` docker image to build the container. We mount the `app/` directory to `/var/www/html` in the container. We also copy the `./docker/default` nginx configuration in the container. We then share port `80` of the container to port `8000` of host machine. Finally, we add the container in the `app-network` that we have created.

Next, we will create the mysql container. We will use [official mysql docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) from dockerhub.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: homestead
      MYSQL_USER: homestead
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
    volumes:
      - mysqldata:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - app-network
```

We set some environment variables which will be used by `mysql container`. When the container starts, `homestead` database will be created with the specified user, password and root password. We will use this details later to connect to the mysql database. We share the volume that we created earlier to `/var/lib/mysql`. We created the named volume to retain the data even after the container is destroyed. Finally we add the mysql container in the same `app-network` network.

Next, we will build the [redis](https://redis.io/) container. We are using [official redis docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/). We mount the `redisdata` volume and add the container to the same network as other containers.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
redis:
    image: redis:4.0-alpine
    volumes:
      - redisdata:/data
    networks:
      - app-network
```

Following is our final `docker-compose.yml`.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
version: '2'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./docker
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: adikari/laravel
    volumes:
      - ./app/:/var/www/html/
    networks:
      - app-network
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.12-alpine
    volumes:
      - ./app/:/var/www/html/
      - ./docker/default:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    ports:
      - 8000:80
    networks:
      - app-network
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: homestead
      MYSQL_USER: homestead
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
    volumes:
      - mysqldata:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - app-network
  redis:
    image: redis:4.0-alpine
    volumes:
      - redisdata:/data
    networks:
      - app-network
volumes:
  mysqldata:
    driver: "local"
  redisdata:
    driver: "local"
networks:
  app-network:
    driver: "bridge"
```

### Nginx configuration

Following is our [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) configuration. Everything in this file is usual nginx configuration except for `fastcgi_pass app:9000;`. `app` is the name of our PHP container. We have specified this in our `docker-compose.yml`.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
server {
  root /var/www/html/public;

  index index.html index.htm index.php;

  server_name _;
  charset utf-8;

  location = /favicon.ico { log_not_found off; access_log off; }
  location = /robots.txt { log_not_found off; access_log off; }

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
  }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    # include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    include fastcgi_params;
    fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
    fastcgi_pass app:9000;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
  }

  error_page 404 /index.php;

  location ~ /\.ht {
    deny all;
  }
}
```

### Installing Laravel

At this point we have everything that we require to install the laravel application. Lets use docker compose `run` command to execute `composer create-project` in the `app` container and install [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

```markup--code markup--pre-code
docker-compose run --rm -w /var/www/ app \
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel html
```

Next we install `predis` for PHP which is required by redis to work.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
docker-compose run --rm -w /var/www/html app composer require predis/predis
```

In the `app/.env` file make the following modifications.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
DB_HOST=mysql
REDIS_HOST=redis
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=redis
```

Run following command to start all docker containers.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
docker-compose up
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your local browser to access the Laravel application.

Next, we will scaffold all of the routes and views we need for authentication.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
docker-compose run --rm -w /var/www/html app php artisan make:auth
```

And finally, we run the migration to create tables required for authentication.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
docker-compose run --rm -w /var/www/html app php artisan migrate
```

Thats all. Congratulations!!

### Conclusion

We have successfully dockerized Laravel application with nginx, mysql and redis. We have used docker compose to glue multiple containers to work togther and serve a Laravel application. In part 3 we will write a small utility script that will allow us to easily work with the docker container.
