[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) is a terminal multiplexer which allows us to create and manage multiple terminal windows. In this post we will configure tmux to have vim style copy and paste.

Tmux configuration file is located at `~/.tmux.conf`. Lets add following configuration in it.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'v' send-keys -X begin-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel
bind-key p paste-buffer
```

To reload updated configuration we will run the following command `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf` in terminal. This will apply the newly updated configuration.

After the configuration is applied, we can press `Ctrl+a v` to enter visual mode in tmux and make selection. `Ctrl+a y` to copy selection and `Ctrl+a p` to paste the selection.

The above configuration will work on most operating system, however we will need to modify it a bit to get it working in osx. There is a bug in osx which prevents tmux from sending the copied output to the clipboard. This bug was fixed in `el capitan` however was regressed on `sierra` again. A small utility called `reattach-to-user-namespace` fixes this issue.

Lets install it by running `brew install reattach-to-user-namespace` and add the following configuration in `~/tmux.conf`.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
set -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l ${SHELL}"
```

```markup--code markup--pre-code
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel 'reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy'
```

The above configuration will pipe tmux yanked contents to `pbcopy` command in osx. `pbcopy` command copies given contents to the osx clipboard.

I have a central [dotfiles](http://github.com/adikari/dotfiles) which I use across multiple machines and operating system. At work I work on centos and my personal laptop run osx. So lets update the above configuration so it works on both.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'v' send-keys -X begin-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel
bind-key p paste-buffer

if-shell 'test "$(uname)" = "Darwin"' 'source ~/.tmux-osx.conf'
```

The only change here is that if the operating system is osx, we source osx specific configuration called `~/.tmux-osx.conf`.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
set -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l ${SHELL}"
```

```markup--code markup--pre-code
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send-keys -X copy-pipe-and-cancel 'reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy'
```
