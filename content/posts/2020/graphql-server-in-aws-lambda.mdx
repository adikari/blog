I have been building GraphQL APIs in a Serverless environment for over 3 years now. I can’t even imagine working with RESTful APIs anymore. Combine the power of GraphQL with the scalability of AWS Lambda, and you have got a server that can handle infinite amounts of traffic.

In this tutorial, we build and deploy a GraphQL server to AWS Lambda and access it via API Gateway endpoint. We use CloudFormation and AWS CLI to deploy all our AWS Resources and application code.

#### What is covered

1. Build a GraphQL Server using Apollo
2. Deploy GraphQL Server to Lambda
3. Use API Gateway to proxy requests to Lambda
4. Use CloudFormation to deploy application stack to AWS
5. Set up Lambda for local development.

TLDR; You can get the full source code for the application from [Github](https://github.com/adikari/apollo-server-lambda-nodejs/tree/server-setup).

### What is GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for describing APIs using a strongly typed schema system. GraphQL server fulfils those queries using existing data. Following are a few of the main advantages of using GraphQL.

#### Query only what your application needs

Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL enables clients to query precisely and only what they need. The server fulfils the client’s request by returning only what the client is asking.

#### GraphQL uses strongly typed system

The strongly typed system of GraphQL enables users to introspect the entire schema. GraphQL API serves as clear documentation about the capabilities of the server and informs about errors during development.

#### Compose your queries in a single request

With GraphQL, you can query multiple resources and get combined responses with a single request. With the lesser number of requests, apps using GraphQL perform much faster.

### What is AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a compute service offered by AWS that lets you run your application code without having to manage any servers. AWS manages all the overheads like infrastructure, security, resources, operating system, and patches so developers can focus on just building the application.

Let’s get started…

### Setting up the project

Let’s start by creating a project folder. Then, change into the directory and initialise a node project. I am using `node 10.x` in the examples. You can install node version of your choice using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).

```markup--code markup--pre-code
mkdir apollo-server-lambda-nodejs
cd apollo-server-lambda-nodejs
yarn init
```

Next, create a folder that houses all our source code.

```
mkdir src
```

Finally, create an index file inside the `src` directory that serves as the lambda handler.

```
cd src
touch index.js
```

Populate the index file with the following code.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
exports.handler = async () => {
  return { body: 'Hello from Lambda' };
};
```

Above code is a very simple Lambda handler which will return `Hello from Lambda` when invoked. Let's first deploy our code to AWS Lambda.

### Package the application code

Before we can deploy our code to Lambda, we need to create a zip of our application and upload it to an S3 bucket. We are using AWS CLI to create the bucket. Set up AWS CLI now by following [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html), if you have not already done so.

Create an S3 bucket to use for deploying our code to Lambda. Pick a unique name for your S3 bucket. The bucket names are unique globally across all AWS Regions.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
aws s3 mb s3://lambda-deploy-asln
```

Create an archive of the application using zip command and verify the files inside the zip.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
zip -rq dist-latest.zip src package.json
zipinfo dist-latest.zip
```

Copy the zip file to S3 using the AWS CLI command.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
aws s3 cp dist-latest.zip s3://lambda-deploy-asln/dist-latest.zip
```

Finally, use the following command to verify that the file exists in S3.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
aws s3 ls s3://lambda-deploy-asln
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*NM_6lTjJvqf4ywUE5lPrdA.png)Copy application package to S3

Now that we have deployed packaged application to S3, next we need to set up our Lambda and API Gateway in AWS. In the next section, we use CloudFormation to set up all necessary AWS Resources.

### Set up AWS lambda with API gateway proxy integration

CloudFormation is an AWS service that helps us to write infrastructure as code. CloudFormation makes it very simple to create and manage our application resources. Let’s use CloudFormation to define our stack.

Create a file named `cloudformation.yml` at the root of the project.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
touch cloudformation.yml
```

Add the following code to the `cloudformation.yml`

I know a lot is happening in the template. Let’s examine the code step by step.

#### Template Parameters

Firstly, we define some parameters that we use in the template. We can pass those variables as parameter overrides when deploying the CloudFormation Stack.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
Description: GraphQL server on AWS lambda

Parameters:
  Version:
    Description: Application version number
    Type: String

  BucketName:
    Description: S3 bucket name where the source code lives
    Type: String
```

#### Lambda Function

We define our lambda function specifying the path from where it should pull the application code. This bucket is the same one we created earlier.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
LambdaFunction:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    Properties:
      Code:
        S3Bucket: !Ref BucketName
        S3Key: !Sub dist-${Version}.zip
      Handler: src/index.handler
      Description: GraphQL Apollo Server
      Role: !GetAtt LambdaExecutionRole.Arn
      Runtime: nodejs10.x
      Timeout: 10
```

We want our Lambda function to be able to send application logs to AWS CloudWatch. Lambda requires special permissions to be able to write logs to CloudWatch. Hence, we create a role that enables writing to CloudWatch and assign it to the Lambda function.

```markup--code markup--pre-code u-paddingRight0 u-marginRight0
LambdaExecutionRole:
    Type: "AWS::IAM::Role"
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: "Allow"
            Principal:
              Service:
                - "lambda.amazonaws.com"
            Action:
              - "sts:AssumeRole"
      Policies:
        - PolicyName: "LambdaFunctionPolicy"
          PolicyDocument:
            Version: '2012-10-17'
            Statement:
            - Effect: Allow
              Action:
              - logs:CreateLogGroup
              - logs:CreateLogStream
              - logs:PutLogEvents
              Resource: "*"
```

#### API Gateway

We also want an HTTP endpoint to invoke the lambda function. API Gateway can be used to create an HTTP endpoint. We can then configure API Gateway to proxy all incoming requests from the client to the Lambda function and send the response from Lambda back to the client.

Firstly, we create an API Gateway RestApi.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
GraphQLApi:
    Type: 'AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi'
    Properties:
      Name: apollo-graphql-api
```

Then, we create an API Gateway Resource, which accepts requests at `/graphql`.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
GraphQLApiResource:
    Type: 'AWS::ApiGateway::Resource'
    Properties:
      ParentId: !GetAtt GraphQLApi.RootResourceId
      RestApiId: !Ref GraphQLApi
      PathPart: 'graphql'
```

Next, we configure the Resource to accept POST requests by creating an API Gateway Method and integrate it with Lambda.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
GraphQLApiMethod:
    Type: 'AWS::ApiGateway::Method'
    Properties:
      RestApiId: !Ref GraphQLApi
      ResourceId: !Ref GraphQLApiResource
      AuthorizationType: None
      HttpMethod: POST
      Integration:
        Type: AWS_PROXY
        IntegrationHttpMethod: POST
        Uri: !Sub arn:aws:apigateway:${AWS::Region}:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/${LambdaFunction.Arn}/invocations
```

Finally, we create an API Gateway Deployment which deploys the API to the specified stage.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
GraphQLApiDeployment:
    Type: 'AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment'
    Properties:
      RestApiId: !Ref GraphQLApi
      StageName: v1
    DependsOn:
      - GraphQLApiResource
      - GraphQLApiMethod
```

#### Lambda / API Gateway permission

At this point, we have both the Lambda function and API gateway configured correctly. However, API Gateway needs special permission to invoke a Lambda function. We permit API Gateway to invoke Lambda by creating a Lambda Permission resource.

```markup--code markup--pre-code u-paddingRight0 u-marginRight0
GraphQLApiPermission:
    Type: 'AWS::Lambda::Permission'
    Properties:
      Action: lambda:invokeFunction
      FunctionName: !GetAtt LambdaFunction.Arn
      Principal: apigateway.amazonaws.com
      SourceArn: !Sub arn:aws:execute-api:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:${GraphQLApi}/*
```

Finally, we export the API URL at the end of the template. We can use this URL to invoke calls to the Lambda.

```markup--code markup--pre-code u-paddingRight0 u-marginRight0
Outputs:
  ApiUrl:
    Description: Invoke url of API Gateway endpoint
    Value: !Sub https://${GraphQLApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/v1/graphql
```

### Deploy CloudFormation stack to AWS

Now that we have the CloudFormation template ready let’s use the AWS CLI command to deploy it to AWS.

Run the following command in your console. Make sure to update the BucketName to whatever the name of the bucket you created earlier is.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file ./cloudformation.yml \
  --stack-name apollo-server-lambda-nodejs \
  --parameter-overrides BucketName=lambda-deploy-asln Version=latest \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PhaZ00tQ_lyDvjmRQF0Xqg.png)

It might take some time to deploy the stack. Lambda function should be ready to start taking requests when the deployment finishes.

### Verify API Gateway and Lambda are working as expected

Now that we have deployed our CloudFormation Stack let us verify if everything is working as expected. We need the API Gateway URL to send a request to our Lambda Function. The API URL we exported in CloudFormation template comes in handy here.

Run the following command to print the API URL in the command line.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
--stack-name=apollo-server-lambda-nodejs \
--query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='ApiUrl'].OutputValue" \
--output text
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*biZO0mxfflMNYoew5gZ58w.png)

Now, use `curl` command to invoke the API URL. You should get "Hello from Lambda" back from the server.

```markup--code markup--pre-code u-paddingRight0 u-marginRight0
curl -d '{}' https://o55ybz0sc5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/graphql
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*MeNxDB_CzIboEOxxCPEgMw.png)

### Add deploy script for easier deployment

If you have noticed, we ran a whole bunch of commands to package and deploy our application. It would be very tedious to have to run those commands every time we deploy the application. Let’s add a bash script to simplify this workflow.

Create a directory called `bin` at the root of the application and add a file named `deploy`.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
mkdir bin
touch bin/deploy
```

Before we can execute the script, we need to set correct file permissions. Let’s do that by running the following command.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
chmod +x bin/deploy
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*PvX0bBt14NVYW3lM47JKhw.png)Create deploy script

At this point, our directory structure should look like in the screenshot below.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*TkNtG7dgqCxC4Cag8Y35aw.png)Current directory structure

Add the following code to the file.

```markup--code markup--pre-code u-paddingRight0 u-marginRight0
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

OUTPUT_DIR=dist
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)
ROOT_DIR="$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )"/..
APP_VERSION=$(date +%s)
STACK_NAME=apollo-server-lambda-nodejs

cd $ROOT_DIR

echo "cleaning up old build.."
[ -d $OUTPUT_DIR ] && rm -rf $OUTPUT_DIR

mkdir dist

echo "zipping source code.."
zip -rq $OUTPUT_DIR/dist-$APP_VERSION.zip src node_modules package.json

echo "uploading source code to s3.."
aws s3 cp $OUTPUT_DIR/dist-$APP_VERSION.zip s3://$S3_BUCKET/dist-$APP_VERSION.zip

echo "deploying application.."
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file $ROOT_DIR/cloudformation.yml \
  --stack-name $STACK_NAME \
  --parameter-overrides Version=$APP_VERSION BucketName=$S3_BUCKET \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

# Get the api url from output of cloudformation stack
API_URL=$(
  aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name=$STACK_NAME \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='ApiUrl'].OutputValue" \
  --output text
)

echo -e "\n$API_URL"

cd $CURRENT_DIR
```

OK, let’s break down what’s going on in this script.

We start by defining some variables. We generate the archive file inside the `dist` directory. We set the app version to the current timestamp at which the script runs. Using timestamp, we can ensure the version number is always unique and incremental.

```markup--code markup--pre-code u-paddingRight0 u-marginRight0
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

OUTPUT_DIR=dist
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)
ROOT_DIR="$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )"/..
APP_VERSION=$(date +%s)
STACK_NAME=apollo-server-lambda-nodejs
```

We then clean up any old builds and create a new `dist` directory.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
echo "cleaning up old build.."
[ -d $OUTPUT_DIR ] && rm -rf $OUTPUT_DIR

mkdir dist
```

Then we run the zip command to archive the source code and its dependencies.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
echo "zipping source code.."
zip -rq $OUTPUT_DIR/dist-$APP_VERSION.zip src node_modules package.json
```

Next, we copy the zip file to the S3 bucket.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
echo "uploading source code to s3.."
aws s3 cp $OUTPUT_DIR/dist-$APP_VERSION.zip s3://$S3_BUCKET/dist-$APP_VERSION.zip
```

Then we deploy the CloudFormation stack.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
echo "deploying application.."
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file $ROOT_DIR/cloudformation.yml \
  --stack-name $STACK_NAME \
  --parameter-overrides Version=$APP_VERSION BucketName=$S3_BUCKET \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Finally, we query the CloudFormation Stack to get the API URL from the CloudFormation Outputs and print it in the console.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
# Get the api url from output of cloudformation stack
API_URL=$(
  aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name=$STACK_NAME \
  --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='ApiUrl'].OutputValue" \
  --output text
)

echo -e "\n$API_URL"
```

### Deploy to AWS using the deploy script

Let’s try out the deployment using the deploy script. The script expects S3\_Bucket variable to be present in the environment. Run the following command to run the deployment. When the deployment is successful, the script will output the API URL that we can use invoke the lambda.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
S3_BUCKET=lambda-deploy-asln ./bin/deploy
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*r3SzIhpC8W4seVhZnzki8w.png)

To simplify this even further, let’s invoke it using yarn. Add the following in your `package.json`.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "S3_BUCKET=lambda-deploy-asln ./bin/deploy"
}
```

Hereafter we can simply run `yarn deploy` do initiate deployments.

### Improve workflow with local Lambda and API Gateway

We frequently modify the application code while working on our application. Right now, deploying to AWS us-east-1 region takes me around 10 seconds. I am on a 40Mb/s upload speed internet connection.

Time to deploy becomes more significant as the size of the application grows. Having to wait 10 seconds or more to realize I have made a syntax error is not productive at all.

Let’s fix this by setting up lambda function locally and invoke it using a local API Endpoint. AWS SAM CLI enables us to do just that. Follow the instruction on [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) to install it.

Once done, from the root of the project, run the following command.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
sam local start-api --template-file cloudformation.yml
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vnj-F40y7o9UzUf-v2hYGg.png)Start local development server

The local endpoint is now available at [http://localhost:3000.](http://localhost:3000.) We can use this endpoint to send requests to our local Lambda.

Open another terminal and run the following command to send a request. You should see the response from our local Lambda function.

```markup--code markup--pre-code u-paddingRight0 u-marginRight0
curl -d '{}' http://localhost:3000/graphql
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-opW391iG4YMbYRMUES9ew.png)Invoke local lambda function

Finally, add the following lines in the `scripts` section of the `package.json`.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
"dev": "sam local start-api --template-file cloudformation.yml"
```

Hereafter we can run `yarn dev` command to start the dev server.

### Set up GraphQL server in Lambda

Without further talking, let’s jump right into the code and build the GraphQL server.

Start by installing the dependencies. We are using [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) to build our GraphQL server. Apollo Server is an open-source implementation of GraphQL Server.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
yarn add apollo-server-lambda graphql
```

Replace the content of `src/index.js` with the following code.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-lambda');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    user: User
  }

  type User {
    id: ID
    name: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: () => ({ id: 123, name: 'John Doe' })
  }
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

exports.handler = server.createHandler();
```

Here, we define a schema which consists of a type User and a user query. We then define a resolver for the user query. For the sake of simplicity, the resolver returns a hardcoded user. Finally, we create a GraphQL handler and export it.

To perform queries to our GraphQL server, we need a GraphQL client. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/core/) is my favourite client. However, any other GraphQL client should be just fine.

Now, let’s run a query to ensure our server is working as expected.

Create a new GraphQL request in Insomnia.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VVG4cRhsHmtKrEJpafLufw.png)Create new GraphQL request![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*fmLSaMhdFtw2Di40r1pf6A.png)Configure GraphQL request

Add the following query in the body and submit the query to `http://localhost:3000`. Assuming your dev server is still running, you should see the following response from the GraphQL server.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_JVrcQ2hcVqffJ62RBwPbw.png)Perform GraphQL request to Local Server

Now that we verified everything is working fine in local server let’s run the following command to deploy the GraphQL server to AWS.

```markup--code markup--pre-code
yarn deploy
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*f8Gg0Ss36LJRGumc.png)Deploy server to AWS

The API URL is outputted in the console once the deployment is complete. Replace the URL in Insomnia with the one from API Gateway. Rerun the query to see it resolve.

### Summary

Congratulations, you have successfully deployed a GraphQL Server in AWS Lambda purely using CloudFormation. The server can receive GraphQL requests from the client and return the response accordingly. We also set up the development environment for local development without adding many dependencies.
