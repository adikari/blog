title: About me
---

Hi, I am Subash Adhikari. 

I am a polyglot software engineer with 12+ years of experience working in various stacks. I am based in Melbourne, Australia. 

I use my software development skills to solve problems in meaningful ways while focusing on User Experience and Usability. I am passionate about programming and am always looking to sharpen my skills or acquire new ones.

These days I am mostly working in AWS and use Nextjs for the frontend. Other than my day job as Engineering manager, I spend most of my spare time working on personal and open source projects.

Iâ€™m currently working on a personal finance management tool built with Nextjs, Go  and GraphQL deployed in AWS.
